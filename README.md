# CovidContactTraceManagement

This program makes use of text files for storing data. Covid pateint and contact suspects register themselves into the system and then the admin marks those two person as contact. An adjacency matrix is used to track contacts. One(1) on adjacency matrix denotes connection. Finally 'jung' library is used to represent that graph in visual form.
